## **Introduction**

The **"Jamf Inventory Look Up"** plugin enables users to easily check the status of MacBook and other Apple devices assigned to individuals within the Jamf Pro environment. The plugin allows for **quick inventory lookups** by user name, making it easy to locate devices. It retrieves key inventory details such as **assigned user**, **location**, **device status**, and **last check-in time**.

This guide will walk you through installing and configuring the plugin in **Agent Studio** in just a few minutes. Let’s get started!

## **Prerequisites**

- Access to Agent Studio

## **What are we building?**

## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **Jamf** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [Jamf Connector](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/jamf?hist=home#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

**Note:** To enable access to **Jamf Pro API endpoints**, ensure that the appropriate privileges are assigned to the user via **Settings → API Roles and Clients → API Roles → Tokens**.

Specifically, confirm the following privilege are granted:

- `Read User`

The permissions are required to retrieve user-related data and perform advanced searches within the Jamf Pro environment using the API.

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.

## **Customization Process:**

In **Jamf Pro**, extension attributes are used to customize the computer inventory with additional fields such as **Assigned To**, **Status**, **Last Check-In**, and **Location**. These attributes are essential for enabling inventory lookups through API integrations.

Please follow the steps below to create the Extension Attributes:

- **Go to:** Settings → Computer Management → Extension Attributes
- **Click**: **New** to create a new extension attribute.
    - **Display Name**: Enter a name like `Status`, `Location`, `Assigned To`  and `Last Check-In`.
    - **Description** *(Optional)*: Briefly explain the field’s purpose.
    - **Data Type**: Use **String** for custom values.
    - **Display Category**: Choose **General** or another category.
    - **Input Type**: Like `Text Field`, `Pop-Up Menu`, `Script`
- **Scope to Devices**: Extension attributes are scoped to all computers and will appear in the **inventory record** under the “Extension Attributes” section.
- **Save & Use**: Fields can be updated via Jamf UI and API.
