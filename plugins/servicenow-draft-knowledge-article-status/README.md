## **Installation Steps**

We recommend setting up **ServiceNow** before installing this plugin. Please follow the [ServiceNow Connector](https://marketplace.moveworks.com/connectors/servicenow#how-to-implement) guide to configure the connection.

**Specifically, confirm the following permissions are granted:**

- **Table Access:**
    - `Read` access to the **kb_knowledge** table.
- **Field Access:**
    - `Read` access to the **short_description**, **number**, **workflow_state**, and **knowledge_base** fields.

Once the connector is successfully configured, follow our [plugin installation documentation](https://help.moveworks.com/docs/ai-agent-marketplace-installation) for detailed steps on how to install and activate the plugin in **Agent Studio**.
